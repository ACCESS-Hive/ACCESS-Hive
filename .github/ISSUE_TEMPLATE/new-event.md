The site has an excellent in-built search facility, so the description plays an important role in people finding your resource, and assessing if this is of interest to them.

Once you have submitted this issue please [contribute the change yourself](https://access-hive.org.au/events/add_event/) if you have the time. The more the community contributes to this resource, the better it becomes and the burden to maintain and improve it Is spread more widely.
