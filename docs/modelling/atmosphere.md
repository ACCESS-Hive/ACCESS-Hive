# Atmospheric modelling

## [UM][UM]
The Unified Model (UM) is the atmospheric component used in the ACCESS coupled models. This model is developed by the UK Met Office and other partner organisations around the world.

### [Getting started information][UMstart]

On this page, you will find information on how to gain access to the UM model and start using the model. You will also find links to various configurations and experiments you can use as a basis to design your experiment.
