# Biogeochemistry

## [WOMBAT][WOMBAT]
WOMBAT is the ocean biogeochemistry model used in ACCESS-ESM1.5. The version of MOM5 with WOMBAT implemented as used by ACCESS-ESM1.5 can be found [here][MOM5-WOMBAT]

## [CASA-CNP][CASA-CNP]
CASA-CNP is the biogeochemistry model used in CABLE. It models the dynamics of the carbon pools and the limitating effects of nitrogen and phosphorous.
