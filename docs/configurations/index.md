# ACCESS Configurations

The Configurations section is still in development.

**What to expect in the next few months?**

The ACCESS-NRI will release model configurations and experiments to the community, including a reference model output for each experiment.

The model configurations and experiments will be documented in this section as they are released by the ACCESS-NRI. The information will cover topics such as where to find a configuration or experiment, how to use a configuration to run your own experiment, where to find the data produced by a released experiment.
