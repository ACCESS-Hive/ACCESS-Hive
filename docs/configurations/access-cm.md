ACCESS-CM stands for ACCESS **C**oupled **M**odel. This means it is a fully-coupled climate model.

ACCESS-NRI will release an ACCESS-CM model configuration. The first release of ACCESS-CM will be derived from the [CSIRO ACCESS-CM2 configuration](#access-cm2) and will include [atmosphere], [land], [ocean] and [sea ice] components.

ACCESS-CM2 is one of Australia’s contributions to the World Climate Research Programme’s Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). The component models are: UM10.6 GA7.1 for the atmosphere, CABLE2.5 for the land surface, MOM5 for the ocean, and CICE5.1.2 for the sea ice. Compared to previous model versions ACCESS-CM2 shows better global hydrological balance, more realistic ocean water properties (in terms of spatial distribution) and meridional overturning circulation in the Southern Ocean but a poorer simulation of the Antarctic sea ice and a larger energy imbalance at the top of atmosphere. This energy imbalance reflects a noticeable warming trend of the global ocean over the spin-up period.
