ACCESS-OM2 is a suite of coupled models between ocean and sea-ice. All models use the [MOM5.1][MOM5.1] ocean model coupled to the [CICE5.1.2][CICE5.1.2] sea ice model via OASIS3-MCT.

The models in the ACCESS-OM2 differ by their grid spatial resolution:

 - [ACCESS-OM2][ACCESS-OM2] at 1° with 50 vertical levels {{ supp }}
 - [ACCESS-OM2-025][ACCESS-OM2-025] at 0.25° with 50 vertical levels {{ supp }}
 - [ACCESS-OM2-01][ACCESS-OM2-01] at 0.1° with 75 vertical levels {{ supp }}
