# Community Resources

<!-- {% include "call_contribute.md" %} -->

In this area of the Hive, we collect content that is not currated by us, but may be helpful for the community. You can [contribute](../contribute/index.md) to this part of the Hive too!

Currently, we provide pointers to the following categories:  
- [Working Groups](community_working_groups.md)    
- [Glossaries](./glossaries/index.md)  
- [Model Evaluation Links](community_model_catalogs)  
- [Training](training/)  
- [Events](./events/index.md)
