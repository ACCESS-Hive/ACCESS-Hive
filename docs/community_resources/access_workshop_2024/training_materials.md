We are excited to welcome you to our Training Day on Monday, September 2nd! This section contains information about setup requirements and training materials, that you will need to participate in each of the sessions. 

In addition to the below requirements, please bring a laptop or other similar device with you to the Training Day to follow along with the hands-on coding activities. Links to all relevant training materials will be sent out closer to the event. 
 
**Important**: These setup requirements must be completed _**before**_ you arrive on the Training Day. NCI project membership requests must be approved manually and can take a couple of business days to be approved, so **please complete this setup as soon as possible**.  

## Morning Sessions Setup Requirements 
Setup instructions for each step can be found at the links provided. Note that many sessions have the same requirements – you need only complete each step once.
