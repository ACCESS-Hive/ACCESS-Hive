description: This half-day workshop introduces running the ACCESS model for new or less experienced users. We focus on the ACCESSESM1.5. The workshop will use a few simple cases to demonstrate how to set up and run the model on NCI's Gadi and focus on what post-processing package is available. Since ACCESS-ESM1.5 is cheaper and faster than ACCESS-CM2, we target to use the Payu through the workshop. We might cover some other components, but it might depend on the time and the users. Participants will need to bring their laptops and have an NCI account; participants may need to prepare before the workshop; the instructions will be loaded online before the event. The workshop will collaborate with CSIRO Aspendale, ACCESS-NRI and CLEX.
