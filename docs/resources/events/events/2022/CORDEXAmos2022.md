# Regional climate downscaling for Australia within the CORDEX framework

This workshop is relevant for those performing regional climate simulations or downscaling with empirical/statistical downscaling approaches including machine learning, as well as those using regional climate projection data in their work. The focus will be on CORDEX related data and modelling. The workshop will have some presentations with extended discussion. Some topics to be covered include:
- Accessing the existing CORDEX-CMIP5 data. How to access and use the data
- Explain the CORDEX-CMIP6 protocol
- What does it say? How can you contribute?
- Who is planning to contribute (or is already working on contributions) to the Australasia domain?
