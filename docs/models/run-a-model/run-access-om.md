# Run {{ model }}

## Prerequisites

### General prerequisites

Before running {{ model }}, you need to fulfil general prerequisites outlined in the [First Steps](/getting_started/first_steps) section.

If you are unsure whether {{ model }} is the right choice for your experiment, take a look at the overview of [ACCESS Models](/models).

### Model-specific prerequisites

**Join the _vk83_ and _qv56_ projects at NCI** 

To join these projects request membership on the respective [vk83](https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/project/vk83/join) and [qv56](https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/project/qv56/join) NCI project pages.

For more information on how to join specific NCI projects, please refer to [How to connect to a project](https://opus.nci.org.au/display/Help/How+to+connect+to+a+project").

**Payu**

[_Payu_](https://github.com/payu-org/payu) is a workflow management tool for running numerical models in supercomputing environments for which there is extensive [documentation](https://payu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

_Payu_ on _Gadi_ is available through a dedicated `conda` environment in the _vk83_ project.

After joining the _vk83_ project load the _payu_ environment:

    module use /g/data/vk83/modules
    module load payu

To check that _payu_ is available, run:

    payu --version

<terminal-window>
<terminal-line data="input">payu --version</terminal-line>
<terminal-line lineDelay="1000">1.1.1</terminal-line>
</terminal-window>

**Note:** _payu_ version >=1.1 is required

## Get {{ model }} configuration

All {{ model }} configurations are available from the [ACCESS-OM2 configs] GitHub repository.  ACCESS-NRI has adapted model configurations from those originally developed by [COSIMA]. 
 
There are global configurations for three resolutions: 1째, 0.25째, 0.1째. For each resolution there are two options of atmospheric forcing: Repeat Year (RYF) and Interannual (IAF). Each configuration also has a biogeochemical (BGC) configuration if this is required. Note the BGC experiments are slower and so consume more resources, both compute time and generally also disk space. 

Each configuration is stored as a separate specially named branch in the [ACCESS-OM2 configs] GitHub repository. They are organised like this for administrative convenience: they are easier to manage and keep grouped for testing. Anyone using a configuration is advised to just clone a single branch and not attempt to keep this structure.

The first step is to decide which configuration is required from the twelve available. For example, if the 1째 horizontal resolution configuration with repeat-year JRA55 forcing (without bgc) is the required configuration then the [`release-1deg_jra55_ryf`](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om2-configs/tree/release-1deg_jra55_ryf) branch is the correct configuration.

The next step is to clone this branch to a location on _Gadi_:

    payu clone -b expt -B release-1deg_jra55_ryf https://github.com/COSIMA/1deg_jra55_ryf.git 1deg_jra55_ryf

!!! note

    These instructions as an example use `payu clone` to clone the `release-1deg_jra55_ryf` 
    branch to a new experiment, `expt`, in a directory named `1deg_jra55_ryf`. 
    See the [`payu` tutorial](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/t/access-om2-payu-tutorial/1750#select-experiment-12) for more information.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Running an {{ model }} configuration

{{ model }} configurations run on [_Gadi_](https://opus.nci.org.au/display/Help/How+to+connect+to+a+project) through a [PBS Job][PBS Jobs] submission managed by _payu_.

The general layout of a _payu_-supported model run consists of two main directories:

- The **laboratory** directory, where all the model components reside. For {{ model }}, it is typically `/scratch/$PROJECT/$USER/access-om2`.

- The **control** directory, where the model configuration resides and from where the model is run (in this example, the cloned directory `~/access-om/1deg_jra55_iaf`).

This separates the small text configuration files from the larger binary outputs and inputs. In this way, the _control_ directory can be in the `$HOME` directory (as it is the only filesystem actively backed-up on _Gadi_). The quotas for `$HOME` are low and strict, which limits what can be stored there, so it is not suitable for larger files.

Furthermore, this separation allows multiple self-resubmitting experiments that share common executables and input data to be run simultaneously.

To setup the _laboratory_ directory, from the _control_ directory run the:

    payu init

This creates the _laboratory_ directory, together with relevant subdirectories, depending on the configuration. 
The main subdirectories of interest are: 

- `work` &rarr; a temporary directory where the model is run. It gets created as part of a run and then removed after the run succeeds.
- `archive` &rarr; the directory where output is stored after each run.

<terminal-window>
<terminal-line data="input">cd ~/access-om/1deg_jra55_yaf</terminal-line>
<terminal-line data="input" directory="~/access-om/1deg_jra55_iaf">payu init</terminal-line>
<terminal-line>laboratory path:  /scratch/$PROJECT/$USER/access-om2</terminal-line>
<terminal-line>binary path:  /scratch/$PROJECT/$USER/access-om2/bin</terminal-line>
<terminal-line>input path:  /scratch/$PROJECT/$USER/access-om2/input</terminal-line>
<terminal-line>work path:  /scratch/$PROJECT/$USER/access-om2/work</terminal-line>
<terminal-line>archive path:  /scratch/$PROJECT/$USER/access-om2/archive</terminal-line>
</terminal-window>

### Payu setup (optional)

As a first step, from within the _control_ directory, it is good practice to run:

    payu setup

This will prepare the model run: create the ephemeral `work` directory based on the experiment configuration, generate manifests and report some useful information to the user, such as the location of the laboratory where the `work` and `archive` directories are located.
<terminal-window>
<terminal-line data="input">payu setup</terminal-line>
<terminal-line>laboratory path: /scratch/$PROJECT/$USER/access-om2</terminal-line>
<terminal-line>binary path: /scratch/$PROJECT/$USER/access-om2/bin</terminal-line>
<terminal-line>input path: /scratch/$PROJECT/$USER/access-om2/input</terminal-line>
<terminal-line>work path: /scratch/$PROJECT/$USER/access-om2/work</terminal-line>
<terminal-line>archive path: /scratch/$PROJECT/$USER/access-om2/archive</terminal-line>
<terminal-line>Loading input manifest: manifests/input.yaml</terminal-line>
<terminal-line>Loading restart manifest: manifests/restart.yaml</terminal-line>
<terminal-line>Loading exe manifest: manifests/exe.yaml</terminal-line>
<terminal-line>Setting up atmosphere</terminal-line>
<terminal-line>Setting up ocean</terminal-line>
<terminal-line>Setting up ice</terminal-line>
<terminal-line>Setting up access-om2</terminal-line>
<terminal-line>Checking exe and input manifests</terminal-line>
<terminal-line>Updating full hashes for 3 files in manifests/exe.yaml</terminal-line>
<terminal-line>Creating restart manifest</terminal-line>
<terminal-line>Writing manifests/restart.yaml</terminal-line>
<terminal-line>Writing manifests/exe.yaml</terminal-line>
</terminal-window>

!!! note

    This step can be skipped as it is also included in the run command. However, running it explicitly helps to check for errors and ensure executable and restart directories are accessible.

### Run configuration

To run an {{ model }} configuration: 

    payu run -f

This will submit a single job to the queue with a run length of `restart_period`.  `restart_period` is defined in the `accessom2.nml` file in the `control directory`.

!!! note

    The `-f` option ensures that `payu` will run even if there is an existing non-empty `work` directory created from a previous failed run or from running `payu setup`.

<terminal-window>
    <terminal-line data="input">payu run -f</terminal-line>
    <terminal-line>payu: warning: Job request includes 47 unused CPUs.</terminal-line>

    <terminal-line>Loading exe manifest: manifests/exe.yaml</terminal-line>
    <terminal-line>payu: Found modules in /opt/Modules/v4.3.0</terminal-line>

    <terminal-line>&lt;job-ID&gt;.gadi-pbs</terminal-line>
</terminal-window>

### Run configuration multiple times

If you want to run an {{ model }} configuration multiple times automatically use the option `-n`:

    payu run -f -n <number-of-runs>

This will run `number-of-runs` times with a total length of `restart_period * number-of-runs`.

For example, to run a configuration for a total of 50 years with `restart_period = 5, 0, 0` (5 years), the `number-of-runs` should be set to `10`:

    payu run -f -n 10

## Monitor {{ model }} runs

Currently, there is no specific tool to monitor {{ model }} runs. However `payu run` reports the PBS `job-ID`, e.g. `110020843.gadi-pbs`, as the last line to the terminal. `qstat` can be used to query the status of the job, e.g.

    qstat 110021035

<terminal-window>
    <terminal-line data="input">qstat 110021035</terminal-line>
    <terminal-line linedelay=500>qstat 110021035</terminal-line>
    <terminal-line linedelay=500>Job id&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;User&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time Use&nbsp;S Queue</terminal-line>
    <terminal-line linedelay=0>---------------------  ---------------- ----------------  -------- - -----</terminal-line>
    <terminal-line linedelay=0>&lt;110021035&gt;.gadi-pbs&nbsp;&nbsp;1deg_jra55_ryf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;$USER&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;time&gt;&nbsp;R&nbsp;normal-exec</terminal-line>
</terminal-window>

To show the status of all your submitted [PBS jobs]:

    qstat -u $USER

<terminal-window>
    <terminal-line data="input">qstat -u $USER</terminal-line>
    <terminal-line linedelay=500>Job id&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;User&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time Use&nbsp;S Queue</terminal-line>
    <terminal-line linedelay=0>---------------------  ---------------- ----------------  -------- - -----</terminal-line>
    <terminal-line linedelay=0>&lt;110021035&gt;.gadi-pbs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1deg_jra55_ryf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;$USER&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;time&gt;&nbsp;R&nbsp;normal-exec</terminal-line>
    <terminal-line linedelay=0>&lt;000000000&gt;.gadi-pbs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;other-job-name&gt;&nbsp;&lt;$USER&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;time&gt;&nbsp;R&nbsp;normal-exec</terminal-line>
    <terminal-line linedelay=0>&lt;000000000&gt;.gadi-pbs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;other-job-name&gt;&nbsp;&lt;$USER&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;time&gt;&nbsp;R&nbsp;normal-exec</terminal-line>
</terminal-window>
If  the `jobname` is set in the [_Master Configuration_ file](#edit-the-master-configuration-file) that is what will appear as your job's _Name_ instead of the default, which is the name of the control directory, in this example `1deg_jra55_ryf`.

_S_ indicates the status of your run, where:

- _Q_ &rarr; Job waiting in the queue to start
- _R_ &rarr; Job running
- _E_ &rarr; Job ending

If there are no jobs listed with your `jobname` (or if no job is listed), your run either successfully completed or was terminated due to an error.

### Stop a run

If you want to manually terminate a run, you can do so by executing:

    qdel job-ID

Which will kill the current job without waiting for it to complete. If you have used the `-n` option, but decide you no longer wish to keep running after the current process completes, you can create a file called `stop_run` in the control directory, and this will prevent `payu` from submitting another job.

### Error and output log files

While the model is running, _payu_ saves the model standard output and standard error in the _access-om2.out_ and _access-om2.err_ log files in the _control_ directory. You can examine the contents of these files to check on the status of a run as it progresses.

At the end of a successful run these log files are archived. If they remain in the `control` directory after the PBS job for a run has completed this is an indication the run has failed.

### PBS output files

When the model completes PBS writes the standard outout and error streams to two files into the control directory: `jobname.o<job-ID>` and `jobname.e<job-ID>` respectively. This is terminal output that isn't otherwise redirected into model log files.

## {{ model }} outputs

At the end of a successful model run, output files (and restart files) are moved (archived) from the `work` directory to the `archive` directory which is a symbolic link to a directory in the `laboratory` (`/scratch/$PROJECT/$USER/access-om2/archive`). The model log files are also moved to the `archive` directory. 

If a model run is unsuccessful the `work` directory is left untouched to facilitate "run forensics" to determine the cause of the model failure.

Outputs and restarts are stored in subfolders within the `archive`, subdivided for each run of the model.

Output folders are `outputXXX` and restart folders `restartXXX`, where _XXX_ is the run number starting from `000`.

Model components are separated into subdirectories within the output and restart directories.

<terminal-window>
<terminal-line data="input">cd /scratch/$PROJECT/$USER/access-om2/archive/1deg_jra55_iaf</terminal-line>
<terminal-line data="input" directory="/scratch/$PROJECT/$USER/access-om2/archive/1deg_jra55_iaf">ls</terminal-line>
<terminal-line class="ls-output-format">output000 pbs_logs restart000</terminal-line>
</terminal-window>

### Model Live Diagnostics

ACCESS-NRI developed the [Model Live Diagnostics](/model_evaluation/#model-live-diagnostics) framework to check, monitor, visualise, and evaluate model behaviour and progress of ACCESS models currently running on _Gadi_.

For a complete documentation on how to use this framework, check the [Model Diagnostics documentation](https://med-live-diagnostics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## Modifying an {{ model }} configuration

Once you are comfortable that you can clone and run an existing configuration it is often the case that you will want to modify the configuration depending on your science goals.

This section describes the model configuration and how to modify it. 

Modifications can be to the way the model is run by `payu`, or can change the way specific model components are configured, or the coupling between them. Sometimes changes are required to both, if the model component changes require a change to the resources needed for the model to complete.

The `config.yaml` file located in the `control` directory, is the `Master Configuration` file, which controls the general model configuration. It contains several parts, some of which it is more likely will need modification, and others are rarely changed without significant understanding of how the model is configured.

### Change run length

One of the most common changes is to how long the model runs. For example it is common when debugging changes to a model to want to reduce the run length to reduce the amount of resources wasted and get faster feedback on changes.

To change the run length, edit the `restart_period` field in the `&date_manager_nml` section of the `~/access-om/1deg_jra55_iaf/accessom2.nml` file:

    &date_manager_nml
        forcing_start_date = '1958-01-01T00:00:00'
        forcing_end_date = '2019-01-01T00:00:00'<br>
        ! Runtime for a single segment/job/submit, format is years, months, seconds,
        ! two of which must be zero.
        restart_period = 5, 0, 0
    &end

For example, to make the model run for only 1 month change `restart_period` to

   restart_period = 0, 1, 0

!!! note

    While `restart_period` can be reduced, it should not be increased to more than 5 years to avoid errors. For more information about the difference between run length and total experiment length, or how to run the model for more than 5 years, refer to the section [Run configuration for multiple years](#run-configuration-for-multiple-years").


### Modify PBS resources

If the model has been altered and needs longer to complete, needs more memory, or you want to change which queue it uses then this is the part of `config.yaml` you need to modify:

```yaml
# If submitting to a different project to your default, uncomment line below
# and replace PROJECT_CODE with appropriate code. This may require setting shortpath
# project: PROJECT_CODE

# Force payu to always find, and save, files in this scratch project directory
# shortpath: /scratch/PROJECT_CODE

queue: normal
walltime: 3:00:00
jobname: 1deg_jra55_ryf
mem: 1000GB
```

These lines can be edited to change the [PBS directives](https://opus.nci.org.au/display/Help/PBS+Directives+Explained") for the [PBS job][PBS jobs].

For example, to run {{ model }} under the `ol01` project (COSIMA Working Group), uncomment the line beginning with `# project` by deleting the `#` symbol and replace `PROJECT_CODE` wih `ol01`.

```yaml
project: ol01
```

If other compute projects will be used to run a configuration then the `shortpath` will also need to be uncommented and the path to the desired `/scratch/PROJECT_CODE` added. Doing this will make sure the same `/scratch` location is used for the _laboratory_ regardless of which project is used to run the experiment.

!!! note

    To run {{ model }}, you need to be a member of a project with allocated _Service Units_ (SU). For more information, check [how to join relevant NCI projects](https://access-hive.org.au/getting_started/first_steps/#join-relevant-nci-projects)

### Syncing output data

As [discussed above](#running-an-access-om-configuration) the _laboratory_ directory is typically in a directory on ephemeral `/scratch` storage where [files are regularly deleted once they have been unaccessed for a period of time](https://opus.nci.org.au/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=156434436). For this reason climate model outputs need to be moved to a location with longer term storage. On _gadi_ this is typically under a project code on `/g/data`.  

_payu_ has in-built support to sync outputs, restarts and a copy of the control repo to another location. To do this modify this section of the `config.yaml`, change `enable` to `True`, and set `path` to a location on `/g/data`. 

```yaml
# Sync options for automatically copying data from ephemeral scratch space to 
# longer term storage
sync:
    enable: False # set path below and change to true
    path: none # Set to location on /g/data or a remote server and path (rsync syntax)
    exclude:
      - '*.nc.*'
      - 'iceh.????-??-??.nc'
```

### Saving model restarts

The model outputs restart files after every run so the model can then begin from the same saved model state.

Restarts files can occupy a significant amount of disk space and it isn't necessary to be able to restart the model at every  point where the model was stopped during a run.  The `restart_freq` specifies a strategy for what restart files are retained. 

This can either be a number, which corresponds to a run number, or a pandas style date-time frequency alias. For example to preserve the ability to restart the model every 50 model run years:
```yaml
restart_freq: 50Y
```
The most recent restarts are retained, and only deleted only after a permanently archived restart has been produced.

See the [documentation for more detail](https://payu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#model).

### Other rarely modified configuration options

#### Model configuration

This tells _payu_ which driver to use for the main model configuration (`access-om2`) and the location of all inputs that are common to all the component models, or submodels.

```yaml
name: common
model: access-om2
input: /g/data/ik11/inputs/access-om2/input_20201102/common_1deg_jra55
```
The `name` field here is not actually used for the configuration run so you can safely ignore it.

#### Submodels

{{ model }} is a coupled model deploying multiple submodels (i.e. [model components]).

This section specifies the submodels and configuration options required to execute the model correctly.

Each submodel contains additional configuration options that are read in when the submodel is running. These options are specified in the subfolder of the _control_ directory, whose name matches the submodel's _name_ (e.g., configuration options for the `ocean` submodel are in the `~/access-om/1deg_jra55_iaf/ocean` directory).

#### Collation

The MOM model typically outputs model diagnostics as tiles: rather than output a single file it is saved as a number of smaller tiles each of which contain a part of the model grid.

The `collate` process combines a number of these smaller files into a single output file. Restart files are typically tiled in the same way and will also be combined together if the `restart` option is set to `true`.

```yaml
collate:
    restart: true
    walltime: 1:00:00
    mem: 30GB
    ncpus: 4
    queue: normal
    exe: /g/data/ik11/inputs/access-om2/bin/mppnccombine</code></pre>
```

#### Miscellaneous

- **runlog**

```yaml
runlog: true
```
When running a new configuration, _payu_ automatically commits changes with `git` if `runlog` is set to `true`.

This should not be changed as it is an essential part of the provenance of an experiment. `payu` updates the manifest files for every run, and relies on `runlog` to save this information in the `git` history.

- **Stack size**

```yaml
stacksize: unlimited
```

`stacksize` is the maximum size (in KiB) of the per-thread resources allocated for each process. This is often set to `unlimited` as some Fortran programs can use a large amount of stack memory, and stack memory errors can be difficult to diagnose.


- **mpirun arguments**

```yaml
mpirun: --mca io ompio --mca io_ompio_num_aggregators 1
```

Line to append mpirun arguments to the `mpirun` call of the model.

- **_qsub_ arguments**

```yaml
qsub_flags: -W umask=027
```

Additional command line arguments for the _qsub_ command. In this case the argument makes sure PBS output files are produced with group readable permissions. 

- **Environment variables**

```yaml
env:
UCX_LOG_LEVEL: 'error'
```

Sets environment variables within the PBS job.

- **Platform-specific defaults**

```yaml
platform: 
nodesize: 48
```

Set platform-specific default parameters.  In this case it sets the default number of cpus per node to 48.

- **User scripts**

```yaml
userscripts:
    error: resub.sh
    run: rm -f resubmit.count
```

A dictionary to run scripts or subcommands at various stages of a _payu_ submission.

`error` gets called if the model does not run correctly and returns an error code.  `run` gets called after the model execution, but prior to model output archive

To find out more about other configuration settings for the `config.yaml` file, check out [how to configure your experiment with _payu_](https://payu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html").

### Edit a single {{ model }} component configuration

Each of the [model components] contains additional configuration options that are read in when the model component is running. These options are typically useful to modify the physics used in the model or the input data.
They are specified in the subfolder of the _control_ directory, whose name matches the submodel's name as specified in the `config.yaml` `submodel` section (e.g., configuration options for the _ocean_ submodel are in the `~/access-om/1deg_jra55_iaf/ocean` directory).
To modify these options please refer to the User Guide of each individual model component.
