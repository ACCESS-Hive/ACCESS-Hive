## UKCA

The [UK Chemistry-Aerosol model (UKCA)](https://www.ukca.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/UKCA) is a community atmospheric chemistry-aerosol global model developed in the United Kingdom. It is suitable for a range of topics in climate and environmental change research.

### Configurations that use UKCA
UKCA chemistry model can be enabled in [ACCESS-CM2](/models/configurations/access-cm#access-cm2), to create the configuration called ACCESS-CM2-Chem.

## GLOMAP

UKCA contains the [GLObal Model of Aerosol Processes (GLOMAP)](https://www.ukca.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/Aerosol_Subproject) aerosol scheme, that can also be used independently. The multi-component, multi-modal GLOMAP model allows simulation of aerosol number, size and concentrations of individual components such as sulphate, sea salt, and different types of carbon.

### Configurations that use GLOMAP
GLOMAP is used in [ACCESS-CM2](/models/configurations/access-cm#access-cm2).
