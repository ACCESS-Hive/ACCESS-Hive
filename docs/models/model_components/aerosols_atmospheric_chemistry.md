## UKCA

The <a href="https://www.ukca.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/UKCA" target="_blank">UK Chemistry-Aerosol model (UKCA)</a> is a community atmospheric chemistry-aerosol global model  developed in the United Kingdom. It is suitable for a range of topics in climate and environmental change research.

### Configurations that use UKCA
UKCA chemistry model can be enabled in <a href="../../configurations/access-cm#access-cm2">ACCESS-CM2</a>, to create the configuration called ACCESS-CM2-Chem.

## GLOMAP

UKCA contains the <a href="https://www.ukca.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/Aerosol_Subproject" target="_blank">GLObal Model of Aerosol Processes (GLOMAP)</a> aerosol scheme, that can also be used independently. The multi-component, multi-modal GLOMAP model allows simulation of aerosol number, size and concentrations of individual components such as sulphate,sea salt and different types of carbon.

### Configurations that use GLOMAP
GLOMAP is used in <a href="../../configurations/access-cm#access-cm2">ACCESS-CM2</a> and ACCESS-CM2-Chem.
