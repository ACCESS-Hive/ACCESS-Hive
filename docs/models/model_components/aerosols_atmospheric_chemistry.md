## [UKCA][ukca-wiki]

The [UK Chemistry-Aerosol model (UKCA)][ukca-wiki] is a community atmospheric chemistry-aerosol global model  developed in the United Kingdom. It is suitable for a range of topics in climate and environmental change research.

### How is UKCA used?
UKCA chemistry model is enabled in ACCESS-CM2-Chem.

## [GLOMAP][glomap-wiki]

UKCA contains an aerosol scheme [GLObal Model of Aerosol Processes (GLOMAP)][glomap-wiki] that can be used independently. The multi-component, multi-modal GLOMAP model allows simulation of aerosol number, size and concentrations of individual components such as sulphate,sea salt and different types of carbon.

### How is GLOMAP used?
GLOMAP is used in ACCESS-CM2 and ACCESS-CM2-Chem.
