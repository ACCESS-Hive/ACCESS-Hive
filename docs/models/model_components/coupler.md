A coupler is a software package that allows synchronised exchanges of coupling information between numerical models representing different components of the climate system.

## OASIS3-MCT

<a href="https://oasis.cerfacs.fr/en/OASIS3-MCT" target="_blank">OASIS3-MCT</a> is the version of the Ocean Atmosphere Sea Ice Soil (OASIS) coupler interfaced with the Model Coupling Toolkit (MCT) from the Argonne National Laboratory. 

### Configurations that use OASIS3-MCT
OASIS3-MCT is the coupler used in <a href="../../configurations/access-cm#access-cm2">ACCESS-CM2</a>, <a href="../../configurations/access-esm#access-esm15">ACCESS-ESM1.5</a> and <a href="../../configurations/access-om#access-om2">ACCESS-OM2</a>.

## NUOPC

The <a href="https://earthsystemmodeling.org/nuopc/" target="_blank">National Unified Operational Prediction Capability (NUOPC)</a> interoperability layer defines conventions and a set of generic components for building coupled models using the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF).

### Configurations that use NUOPC
NUOPC is not yet included in any ACCESS-NRI-supported configuration, but will be included in ACCESS-OM3, a configuration currently under development.
