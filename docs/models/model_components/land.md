## <div class="center-icons"> [CABLE][cable-wiki] {{ supported }} </div>

Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE)](cable-web) is a land surface model, used to calculate the fluxes of momentum, energy, water and carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere. It also models the main biogeochemical cycles of the land ecosystem. 

### How is CABLE used?

CABLE can be run as a standalone model, for a single location, a region or globally. Coupled to the Met Office [Unified Model (UM)](um-web), CABLE provides the land surface component of the ACCESS Earth System Model (ACCESS-ESM) and ACCESS Coupled Model (ACCESS-CM).

CABLE is an open source model developed by a community of Australian climate science researchers. [Registration][cable-wiki] is required to access the CABLE code repository.

## <div class="center-icons"> [JULES][jules-web] {{ supported }} </div>

The [Joint UK Land Environment System (JULES)](jules-web) is a community land surface model that can be used both as a standalone model and as the land surface component in the UM model. By modelling different land surface processes (surface energy balance, hydrological cycle, carbon cycle, dynamic vegetation, etc.) and their interaction with each other, JULES provides a framework to assess the impact of modifying a particular process on the ecosystem as a whole, e.g., the impact of climate change on hydrology.

<!---
Some of the ACCESS models used for weather simulations use JULES instead of CABLE. For example, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) uses the JULES land surface scheme in its numerical weather prediction models such as ACCESS S (Seasonal) and C (City).
