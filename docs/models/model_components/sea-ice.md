CICE is a numerical model for simulating the growth, melting and movement of polar sea ice. This software package was developed by researchers at [Los Alamos National Laboratory team][lanl-web] and is currently managed by the [CICE Consortium][cice-web], an international group of institutions formed to maintain and develop CICE in the public domain.

[CICE5][cice5-wiki] is the current version used in ACCESS model configurations.

[CICE6][cice6-wiki] is currently under development.
