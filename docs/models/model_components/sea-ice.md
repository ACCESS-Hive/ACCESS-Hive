## CICE
CICE is a numerical model for simulating the growth, melting and movement of polar sea ice. This software package was developed by researchers at <a href="https://www.lanl.gov" target="_blank">Los Alamos National Laboratory team</a> and is currently managed by the <a href="https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/About-Us/wiki" target="_blank">CICE Consortium</a>, an international group of institutions formed to maintain and develop CICE in the public domain.

### Configurations that use CICE
There are 2 CICE versions currently used in ACCESS models: <a href="https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/CICE-svn-trunk" target="_blank">CICE5</a> and <a href="https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/CICE" target="_blank">CICE6</a>.
