## WOMBAT

The World Ocean Model of Biogeochemistry And Trophic-dynamics (WOMBAT) is the ocean biogeochemistry module added to ACCESS models. The core of WOMBAT is a Nutrient, Phytoplankton, Zooplankton and Detritus (NPZD) cycle. WOMBAT simulates the evolution of open-ocean phosphate, oxygen, dissolved inorganic carbon, alkalinity, iron and carbon fluxes with one zooplankton and one phytoplankton class.

### Configurations that use WOMBAT

WOMBAT is included in <a href="../../configurations/access-om">ACCESS-OM</a> and <a href="../../configurations/access-esm">ACCESS-ESM</a> configurations, as a tracer package within <a href="../ocean#modular-ocean-model-mom">MOM</a>.
