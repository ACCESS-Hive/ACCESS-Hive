## WOMBAT

The World Ocean Model of Biogeochemistry And Trophic-dynamics (WOMBAT) is the ocean biogeochemistry module added to ACCESS models. The core of WOMBAT is a Nutrient, Phytoplankton, Zooplankton and Detritus (NPZD) cycle. WOMBAT simulates the evolution of open-ocean phosphate, oxygen, dissolved inorganic carbon, alkalinity, iron and carbon fluxes with one zooplankton and one phytoplankton class.

### Configurations that use WOMBAT

WOMBAT is included in [ACCESS-OM](/models/configurations/access-om) and [ACCESS-ESM](/models/configurations/access-esm) configurations, as a tracer package within [MOM](/models/model_components/ocean#modular-ocean-model-mom).
