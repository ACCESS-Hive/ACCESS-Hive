## <div class="center-icons"> WOMBAT  </div>

The World Ocean Model of Biogeochemistry And Trophic-dynamics (WOMBAT) is the ocean biogeochemistry module added to ACCESS models. The core of WOMBAT is a Nutrient, Phytoplankton, Zooplankton and Detritus (NPZD) cycle. WOMBAT simulates the evolution of open-ocean phosphate, oxygen, dissolved inorganic carbon, alkalinity, iron and carbon fluxes with one zooplankton and one phytoplankton class.

### How is WOMBAT used?
WOMBAT is applied as a tracer package in the ACCESS ocean model [MOM5][mom5-github]. In the ACCESS-OM2 configuration, WOMBAT is used in MOM5 and coupled with sea ice biogeochemistry. WOMBAT is also applied in [MOM5 of the ACCESS-ESM1.5 configuration][MOM5-esm-code]  used for CMIP6.
