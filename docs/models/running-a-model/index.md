# <div class="highlight-bg"> Running a Model </div>

Here, we are providing the information to run different ACCESS models.

If *Model*, *Model Component* or *Model Configuration* are not familiar terms for you, please check out our [Model overview](../index.md).

If you have not run a model before, our [Getting Started Guide](./running-getting_started.md) will give you the basics to access the Model infrastructure on the high-performance-computing facility Gadi@NCI.

Detailed guides for the different Model configurations can then be found on the following pages:  
-  [Run ACCESS-ESM](./running-access-esm.md) for the ACCESS Earth System Model configurations  
-  [Run ACCESS-CM](./running-access-cm.md) for the ACCESS Coupled Model configurations  
-  [Run ACCESS-AM](./running-access-am.md) for the ACCESS Atmosphere Model configurations  
-  [Run ACCESS-OM](./running-access-om.md) for the ACCESS Ocean Model configurations  
-  [Run ACCESS-S](./running-access-s.md) for the ACCESS Seasonal configuration
