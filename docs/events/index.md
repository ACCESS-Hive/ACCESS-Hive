**GC5 Assessment Workshop**

*8-10th November 2022 0830-1300 UTC.*

The UM Partnership Team and GC Programme Team are running a GC5 assessment workshop, to assess the latest configuration of the Global Coupled model.

The workshop will be a hybrid event with an option to attend online or in-person at Met Office Collaboration Building, Exeter. We will discuss the assessment of the latest GC5 configuration in a range of model simulations in a seamless context and sessions will broadly consist of:
- Summary of GC5 physics changes
- General model assessment
- Summary from Priority Evaluation Groups (PEGs)
- Summary from Collaboration Groups (CoGs)
- Upcoming changes in GC science and tools
- Discussions

Please fill in the [registration form](https://forms.office.com/r/XyRvLKjNtH) to confirm attendance by 21st October

For any further questions please contact Luke Roberts, Prince Xavier or Charline Marzin at the Met Office.

[**Ground truthing future climate change**][amos2022]

*AMOS 2022, 27 November 2022, Adelaide, SA*

*Convenors: Dr Sarah Kachovich, Dr Linda Armbrecht, Dr Luke Nothdurft*

Scientific ocean drilling provides the robust baseline data on global climate evolution over extended geologic time periods that are critical for improving climate model performance. By targeting how the climate system operates across a wide array of past climate states, scientific ocean drilling has, and continues to, obtain the data necessary to calibrate and improve numerical models used to project future climate impacts and inform mitigation strategies.

Join us in this session where we aim to connect climate and ocean modellers to our rich (50+ years of drilling) database and unanswered questions in scientific ocean drilling. By addressing key questions about Earth’s past, present, and future through interdisciplinary research, we are aiming to spark new collaborations and proposals that will lead to a more profound understanding of Earth as one integrated, interconnected system.

[**The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite: A primer**][amos2022]

*AMOS 2022, 27 November 2022, Adelaide, SA*

*Convenors: Dr Benoit Legresy, Dr Shane Keating, Prof. Nicole Jones*

The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite, which will launch in November 2022, is a ground-breaking wide-swath altimetry mission that will observe fine details of the ocean dynamics at a resolution 10 times finer than current satellites. SWOT is jointly developed by NASA and CNES with contributions from researchers around the world, including Australia. The Australian government, the Integrated Marine Observing System, and the Australian marine science community are investing in SWOT through calibration/validation and synergistic in situ measurements of fine-scale ocean dynamics in the Australian region. This workshop will present a primer on the principles of the satellite and instrument, how it works, and what are its possibilities and limitations compared to existing altimetry products. This will be complemented with a brief summary of ocean research related to and enabled by SWOT, including internal waves and tides, sub-mesoscale dynamics, the geoid, and mean dynamic topography. The goal of the workshop is to provide oceanographers, hydrologists and other users of altimetry data with the information they need to prepare for the arrival of SWOT data in late 2023.

[**Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator (ACCESS) modelling**][amos2022]

*AMOS 2022, 27 November 2022, Adelaide, SA*

*Convenors: Dr Tilo Ziehn, Arnold Sullivan*

This half-day workshop introduces running the ACCESS model for new or less experienced users. We focus on the ACCESSESM1.5. The workshop will use a few simple cases to demonstrate how to set up and run the model on NCI's Gadi and focus on what post-processing package is available. Since ACCESS-ESM1.5 is cheaper and faster than ACCESS-CM2, we target to use the Payu through the workshop. We might cover some other components, but it might depend on the time and the users. Participants will need to bring their laptops and have an NCI account; participants may need to prepare before the workshop; the instructions will be loaded online before the event. The workshop will collaborate with CSIRO Aspendale, ACCESS-NRI and CLEX.

[**Regional climate downscaling for Australia within the CORDEX framework**][amos2022]

*AMOS 2022, 27 November 2022, Adelaide, SA*

*Convenors: Jason Evans, Marcus Thatcher*

This workshop is relevant for those performing regional climate simulations or downscaling with empirical/statistical downscaling approaches including machine learning, as well as those using regional climate projection data in their work. The focus will be on CORDEX related data and modelling. The workshop will have some presentations with extended discussion. Some topics to be covered include:
- Accessing the existing CORDEX-CMIP5 data. How to access and use the data
- Explain the CORDEX-CMIP6 protocol
- What does it say? How can you contribute?
- Who is planning to contribute (or is already working on contributions) to the Australasia domain?

**2023 Unified Model Users Tutorial (expression of interest**

*Week of 6th or 13th February 2023*

The Met Office UM Partnership team are starting to plan the Unified Model training course to be held at the Bureau of Meteorology in 2023. The provisional dates for this course are either the week of 6th or 13th February 2023 at the Bureau of Meteorology, Melbourne.

Expression of Interest closes: 1 October, 2022, [fill form](https://forms.office.com/r/dgtNtNfZWX)
