description: The tutorial will be aimed at ‘Beginner to Intermediate’ UM Users. The tutorial will be structured as mornings with talks and seminars in conference rooms at the Bureau, and then break out sessions in afternoons for practicals on rose/cylc, global climate configurations, nesting suite and regional configurations, UM working practices and LFRic data. If you are unsure if this tutorial is suitable for your level of expertise, please don’t hesitate to contact luke.roberts(at)metoffice.gov.uk or bethan.white(at)bom.gov.au
