# Ground truthing future climate change

Scientific ocean drilling provides the robust baseline data on global climate evolution over extended geologic time periods that are critical for improving climate model performance. By targeting how the climate system operates across a wide array of past climate states, scientific ocean drilling has, and continues to, obtain the data necessary to calibrate and improve numerical models used to project future climate impacts and inform mitigation strategies.

Join us in this session where we aim to connect climate and ocean modellers to our rich (50+ years of drilling) database and unanswered questions in scientific ocean drilling. By addressing key questions about Earthâ€™s past, present, and future through interdisciplinary research, we are aiming to spark new collaborations and proposals that will lead to a more profound understanding of Earth as one integrated, interconnected system.
