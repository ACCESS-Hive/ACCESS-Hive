# Setup
## Get the documentation source
You need to clone the ACCESSHub Community repository to your local machine:
```
   git clone git@github.com:ACCESS-NRI-Community/ACCESSHub.git
```

## Install Material for Mkdocs (recommended)
MkDocs allows you to build the documentation locally so you can check your modifications before committing them to the site. As such, we recommend you install Material for Mkdocs on your local machine:
 - using pip
 ```
    pip install mkdocs-material
 ```
 - using conda
 ```
    conda create -n doc -c conda-forge mkdocs-material
 ```
