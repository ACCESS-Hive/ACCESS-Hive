JRA55-do is a surface dataset for driving ocean-sea ice models and used in phase 2 of OMIP (OMIP-2). JRA55-do corrects the atmospheric reanalysis product JRA-55 using satellite and other atmospheric reanalysis products. The merits of JRA55-do are the high horizontal resolution (~55 km) and temporal interval (3 h).

ERA5 provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land and oceanic climate variables. The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.

Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1959 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.

ERA5 combines vast amounts of historical observations into global estimates using advanced modelling and data assimilation systems.
