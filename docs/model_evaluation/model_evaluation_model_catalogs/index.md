# ACCESS-NRI intake Model Catalog

The ACCESS-NRI intake catalog aims to provide a way for Python users to discover and load data across a broad range of climate data products available on the Australian NCI supercomputer Gadi. For detailed information, tutorials and more, please go to the

## What is the ACCESS-NRI intake Model Catalog?

The ACCESS-NRI catalog is essentially a table of climate data products that exist on Gadi. Each entry in the table corresponds to a different product, and the columns contain attributes associated with each productâ€“things like the models, frequencies and variables available. Users can search on the attributes to find the products that might be useful to them. For example, a user might want to know which data products contain variables X, Y and Z at monthly frequency. The ACCESS-NRI catalog enables users to find products that satisfy their query and to subsequently load their data without having to know the location and structure of the underlying files.

## Showcase: Search with intake to easily load and plot data

```py
import intake
catalog = intake.cat.access_nri
```
You can then search for a model, variable, frequency and more across all the project that we provide support for on Gadi:
```py
catalog_filtered = catalog.search(name="cmip6_oi10", variable="burntFractionAll")
```
You can then easily load this particular datastore and look at its metadata or keywords
```py
esm_datastore = catalog_filtered.to_source()
esm_datastore.keys()
```

```py
['iceh_XXXX_XX.1mon',
 'iceh_XXXX_XX_daily.1day',
 'ocean_budget.1yr',
 'ocean_daily.1day',
 'ocean_grid.fx',
 'ocean_month.1mon',
 'ocean_scalar.1mon',
 'ocean_scalar_snapshot.1day']
```

The potential of the intake catalog can also be shown in this quick example (where we pretend that we have already searched for a specific datastore as part of NCI project `ik11`):
```py
import intake
from distributed import Client
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
client = Client(threads_per_worker=1)
client.dashboard_link

# Load intake catalog and filter for specific datastore
catalog = intake.cat.access_nri
# Here you could include your search for a specific datastore. We assume that we were looking for this specific one:
esm_datastore = catalog["025deg_jra55_iaf_omip2_cycle1"]
esm_datastore_filtered = esm_datastore.search(variable="temp_global_ave")

# Load datastore
dataset_dict = esm_datastore_filtered.to_dataset_dict(progressbar=False)

# Plot a timeseries of global average temperatures
dataset_dict["ocean_scalar_snapshot.1day"]["temp_global_ave"].plot(label="daily")
dataset_dict["ocean_scalar.1mon"]["temp_global_ave"].plot(label="monthly")
plt.title("")
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
```
