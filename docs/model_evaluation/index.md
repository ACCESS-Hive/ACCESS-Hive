#  Data, Model Evaluation and Diagnostics 

<!-- Model evaluation is about measuring how fit for purpose a particular model is.  -->

Model evaluation in climate science is the process of assessing the performance and reliability of computational models that simulate the Earth's climate system. It involves comparing model predictions to observed data to determine the model's accuracy and usefulness. In doing so, we can understand how well a model represents real-world climate processes and make predictions about future climate trends. Such rigorous model evaluation allows scientists to identify model strengths, weaknesses and uncertainties, as well as refine models to enhance their predictive capabilities.

## Prerequisites
To get started on using Model Evaluation and Diagnostics tools on Gadi visit [First Steps](/getting_started/first_steps) section.
<!--If you are new to MED and are wondering [*"What is Model Evaluation and Diagnostics about?"*](./model_evaluation_getting_started/index.md), we recommend you read our [Getting Started with MED page](./model_evaluation_getting_started/index.md): -->

### Tools in development

For the evaluation and diagnosis of ACCESS climate models, the following tools are currently being setup:  

* Data format processing tools like APP4  
* An Evaluation Recipe Gallery with searching functionality  

While this work is in progress, you can refer to a collection of links to existing tools (not curated by ACCESS-NRI) in the [community tab](../community_resources/index.md). -->

<!-- THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE

## TBD: CMORisation

TBD: Raw data vs. curated data: CMORized vs. not! What does CMORized actually mean (look at ESMValTool documentation)?
TBD: Add APP4 to navigation (replace **Model Format Processing**?)
TBD: Tools to check if data is CMOR-compliant (raise issue)
TBD: Discuss with Dougie: How can we identify what is CMORized and what is not?
