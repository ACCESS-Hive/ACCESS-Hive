The COSIMA (Consortium for Ocean-Sea Ice Modelling in Australia) Cookbook / Recipes is a framework for analysing output from ocean-sea ice models. The focus is on the ACCESS-OM2 suite of models being developed and run by members of COSIMA: Consortium for Ocean-Sea Ice Modelling in Australia.

The framework is suited to analysing any MOM5/MOM6 output, as well as output from other models.

The cookbook is structured as follows:

- The cosima-cookbook repository includes boiler-plate code and scripts that underpin the cookbook, including a database for exploring and loading available data.
- The cosima-recipes repository includes example notebooks on which you can base your analyses.
