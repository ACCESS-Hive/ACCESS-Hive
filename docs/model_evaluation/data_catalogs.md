## [NCI datasets][NCI-geonetwork] {{ recom }}

NCI has an extensive catalog of datasets of interest to the weather and climate community. These datasets are directly available on the NCI supercomputer and the [Australian Research Environment][ARE-opus]

## [CLEX NCI Data Collection Intake Catalogue][Intake-CLEX] {{ recom }}

This is an Intake catalogue maintained by the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes [(CLEX)][CLEX-web].
Only datasets from the NCI Catalog are referenced.
The catalogue is available in intake's default catalogue list in the CLEX Conda environment.
Two notebooks are provided in the docs folder showing how to access the ERA5 and CIP6 datasets.

## [Intake-Ilamb Catalog][Intake-Ilamb] {{ supp }}

The Intake-Ilamb catalog provides an yaml-style intake catalog of the reference data used for ESM model benchmarking in the International Land Model Benchmarking [(ILAMB)][ILAMB-web] effort.

## [FLUXNET][FLUXNET-web] {{ comm }}

FLUXNET is an international “network of networks,” tying together regional networks of earth system scientists. FLUXNET scientists use the eddy covariance technique to measure the cycling of carbon, water, and energy between the biosphere and atmosphere. Scientists use these data to better understand ecosystem functioning, and to detect trends in climate, greenhouse gases, and air pollution.

### [OZFlux][OZFlux-web] {{ comm }}

OzFlux is an ecosystem research network set up to provide Australian, New Zealand and global ecosystem modelling communities with consistent observations of energy, carbon and water exchange between the atmosphere and key Australian and New Zealand ecosystems.
