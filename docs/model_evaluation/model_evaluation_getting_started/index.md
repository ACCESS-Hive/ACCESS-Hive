# Getting Started with Model Evaluation at NCI

<!--Welcome to Model Evaluation and Diagnostics! -->

## What is MED?

Model Evaluation and Diagnostics (MED) of ACCESS models includes:

<ul>
  <li><b>Evaluation</b>
    <br>
    Model evaluation involves scrutinising a model's performance by comparing its output with observations and through Model/Observation confrontations. It also includes experiment comparisons, model testing with different scenarios and inter-model comparisons such as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP).
  <li>
    <b>Diagnostics</b>
    <br>
    Model diagnostics is essentially constant monitoring of model runs to detect any anomalies or inconsistencies. Thorough analysis of outputs are used to verify the model's accuracy over time.
    <br>
</ul>

## How to get started with MED?

Here you can find information on how to access curated data stored at NCI and how to use it to evaluate specific models, such as comparing model output with observational data.
