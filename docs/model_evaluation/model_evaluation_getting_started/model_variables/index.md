# Model Output and Variables

Speaking a common language and using the same variables is key for a united climate modelling community. While we are trying to bring together modellers from different communities, we understand that the variables used for climate modelling may differ for historical reasons. Here, we are collating lists of different widely used variable formats.

<!-- We have created a prototype of markdown files with variable tables that can be queried via jquery -->
<!-- Because they were not ready for quick searches (jquery with extended html tables is slow), we did not include them in the Legacy Relase (July/August 2023). -->
<!-- The code and markdown files are hosted on a github repository, however: https://github.com/svenbuder/access_model_variables -->

# Variables for CMIP version 6<br>(Coupled Model Intercomparison Project)

# Variables for ERA5 atmospheric reanalysis

ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1940 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) at ECMWF. ERA5 provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land and oceanic climate variables.

A full list of ERA5 parameters is available on the [ECMWF database](https://codes.ecmwf.int/grib/param-db/). It covers both the [ERA5 parameter listings](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Parameterlistings) as well as the [ERA5-LAND parameter listings](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5-Land%3A+data+documentation#ERA5Land:datadocumentation-parameterlistingParameterlistings).
