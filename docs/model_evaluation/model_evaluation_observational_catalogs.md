# Observational Data Catalogue

ACCESS-NRI and NCI as the data host are currating data collections on the NCI storage and we are working on including new, currated data collections.

You can search the available data collections on the NCI Data Collections website:

<div class="card-container">
    <a href="https://geonetwork.nci.org.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/search" target="_blank" class="vertical-card aspect-ratio2to1">
        <div class="card-image-container">

        </div>
        <div class="card-text-container bold">Search for data here</div>
    </a>

Below you can see a screenshot of an example catalogue (NCI project `ct11`) of ACCESS-NRI Replicated Datasets for Climate Model Evaluation (you can find this particular entry by searching `ACCESS-NRI`):

<!-- In particular, we want to highlight the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phases 6 and 5 that are hosted by NCI as a sponsor of the [Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF)](https://esgf.nci.org.au/projects/esgf-nci/). The ESGF are federated data centres across the globe that enable access to the largest archive of climate data world-wide. This portal allows you to find, select and download data files from the federation. -->
