# How to contribute guide
???+ abstract
    The aim of this How to is to enable you to:

     - add or modify a link to a new documentation in an existing page
     - add a new page or tab with new documentation

This documentation is based on the [Material for Mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme. Please see the documentation for the theme or for [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) for a full explanation of all the capabilities.

The documentation is written in Markdown format. Please see this [cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for a quick reference to the base syntax. Please note that Material for Mkdocs extends that syntax.
