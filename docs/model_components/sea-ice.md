## CICE
CICE is a software package developed by researchers at [Los Alamos National Laboratory team][lanl-web] with funding from the US Department of Energy. CICE models the dynamics and thermodynamics of ice. 

The software program is managed by the [CICE Consortium][cice-web], an international group of institutions formed to maintain and develop CICE in the public domain.

[CICE5][cice5-wiki] is the version currently used in ACCESS.

[CICE6][cice6-wiki] is under development.
