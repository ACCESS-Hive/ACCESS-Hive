## Still need help?

For resources developed by another party that ACCESS-Hive links to, there should be information on how to get help on the linked site. If there are no obvious channels for help, or the help is not adequate consider asking for assistance from fellow members of your community on the <a href="https://forum.access-hive.org.au" target="_blank">ACCESS-Hive Forum</a>.

In the case of ACCESS-NRI supported documentation and software, please ask on the <a href="https://forum.access-hive.org.au" target="_blank">ACCESS-Hive Forum</a>. 

How to get help and support, and what assistance is available on the forum is outlined in <a href="https://forum.access-hive.org.au/t/access-help-and-support/908" target="_blank">ACCESS Help and Support</a>.

There is also a <a href="https://forum.access-hive.org.au/t/support-faq-frequently-asked-questions/1021" target="_blank">Support FAQ</a> covering some of the more common questions you might have about what support is provided, how it is provided and what you can expect.
