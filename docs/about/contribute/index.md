# How to contribute guide

Although we encourage everyone to get involved and contribute to the ACCESS-Hive in order to adequately represent the needs of the entire ACCESS community, we recognise not everyone will have the time to do so. In case you do not have a lot of time, please consider sharing your ideas via [issues on the ACCESS-Hive GitHub repository][Issues] so someone might be able to add them to the ACCESS-Hive site for you.

    The aim of this how-to is to enable you to:

     - add or modify a link to a new documentation in an existing page
     - how to deal with relevant documentation that is not currently on a website
     - modify the navigation of the site to add a new page for example

## Become a member of the ACCESS-Hive organisation

The ACCESS-Hive organisation is open to any member of the ACCESS community. Furthermore, organisation members have write access to the ACCESS-Hive repository which means they can create branches to contain their modifications instead of creating their own forks. As such, we encourage you to become a member of the organisation by asking for an invite on the [ACCESS-NRI forum][ACCESSforum].

## Process to contribute

Since ACCESS-Hive is a portal for documentation hosted elsewhere, the documentation you want to add needs to be available from an existing website. We realise people might have standalone files or other information to share, please see our [Standalone documentation page][standalone_doc] for ways to easily upload your documentation to a site.

There are two main ways to contribute to the site:

 - you can modify an existing page [directly from GitHub][directedit]. This is a simple way suitable to light modifications.
 - you can work [on your local computer][localedit] and use Git to manage your modifications. This is recommended for more involved modifications. It is the only possible way to add new pages or modify the navigation of the site.
