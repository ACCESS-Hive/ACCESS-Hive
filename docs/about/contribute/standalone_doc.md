# Standalone documentation

You may have very valuable resources to share which are not currently available through any website, it is what we call "standalone documentation" in the current context.

To contribute these resources to ACCESS-Hive, you will first need to make them available on the internet. Below are some ideas on how to do that:

1. Check if your organisation has a documentation or information site suitable for your resource.
1. Check if ACCESS-NRI has a documentation site suitable for your resource. Note in this case, you will be asked about ownership and license associated with your resource.
1. Publish your documentation via [Zenodo][zenodo]. This will clarify the licensing and reuse conditions.
