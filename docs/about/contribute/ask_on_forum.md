# Using the Hive Forum

The <a href="https://forum.access-hive.org.au" target="_blank">Hive forum</a> is a place for the ACCESS Community to come together, share ideas, organise and plan shared activities.

## Getting ready

You can start a new discussion topic on the <a href="https://forum.access-hive.org.au" target="_blank">Hive Forum</a> in just 3 simple steps: 

<i class="fa-regular fa-square-check nri-light-blue-color with-padding"></i> <a href="https://forum.access-hive.org.au/docs?topic=884" class="checklist-item bold"> Register to the ACCESS-Hive Forum </a>

<i class="fa-regular fa-square-plus nri-light-blue-color with-padding"></i> <a href="https://forum.access-hive.org.au/docs?topic=790" class="checklist-item bold"> Create a new topic for your request </a>

&emsp; <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb nri-orange-color with-padding"></i> <a href="https://forum.access-hive.org.au/docs?topic=790" class="checklist-item small-txt"> How to write a good help request? </a>

<i class="fa-solid fa-tag nri-light-blue-color with-padding fa-sm"></i> <a href="https://forum.access-hive.org.au/docs?topic=846" class="checklist-item bold"> Tag the request with the label `help` </a>

After a discussion topic is posted on the forum, the ACCESS-NRI and community experts will respond with the relevant information by following a 5-step process, as below: 

<i class="fa-solid fa-star nri-light-blue-color with-padding fa-sm"></i> ACCESS-NRI monitors the topics tagged with `help` keyword on a regular basis.
- After a request is received, we will let you know within 1 working day if the request is `in scope`. 
- A helper will then follow the `in scope`, `help` request through to a resolution. 
- You will receive a progress update at least once a week. 

<i class="fa-regular fa-circle-check"></i> Request is solved.
