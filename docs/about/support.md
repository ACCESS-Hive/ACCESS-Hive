## Support levels

The site uses a system of tags to identify who supports the linked documentation or software, and the level of support you can expect:

{{supp}} Supported by ACCESS-NRI

{{recom}} Recommended by ACCESS-NRI

{{comm}} Community contributed

### Supported by ACCESS-NRI {{supp}}

Documentation that is actively maintained and supported by ACCESS-NRI. This is documentation that was either created by ACCESS-NRI, or it is existing documentation for which ACCESS-NRI has taken over responsibility.

### Recommended by ACCESS-NRI {{recom}}

Documentation for third-party software that ACCESS-NRI recommends and facilitates the use of at [NCI][nci-web] as a service to the community. This means ACCESS-NRI supports the infrastructure required to run the software, but not necessarily the software itself. 

### Community contributed {{comm}}

Documentation that is of use to the community, but is not explicitly endorsed or supported by ACCESS-NRI. 

## How to get help

Each entry on ACCESS-Hive links to another web site. There should be information on how to get help on the linked site. In the case of ACCESS-NRI supported documentation and software, marked {{supp}}, if there is not information on how to get help, or your query is not appropriate for the support channels provided, please [contact ACCESS-NRI directly][contact].
