# ACCESS-Hub

ACCESS-Hub is a portal to all documentation pertinent to the Australian Community Climate & Earth System Simulator, ACCESS, and its model components.

This portal goal is primarily to link to documentations hosted on other sites. It is not intended to host the documentation itself.

The site is divided in two major components:

- **ACCESS Community Hub** (the current site): This site is to group documentation resources from various sources contributed by the ACCESS Community.
- **ACCESS-NRI Hub**: This site is to group the documentation supported by the ACCESS-NRI.

You can switch between the two sites at any time from the last tab in each site header or using the button below.

[Go to ACCESS-NRI Hub](https://access-hub.github.io/ACCESS-Hub/ACCESS-NRI/index.html){ .md-button}
