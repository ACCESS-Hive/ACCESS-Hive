# ACCESS-Hive

ACCESS-Hive is a portal to all documentation relevant to the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator, ACCESS, and the wider ACCESS community. ACCESS-Hive is developed for and by the ACCESS community following an open-source development.

ACCESS-Hive is part of an effort to design higher quality and more accessible documentation for ACCESS and its community. Providing a single access point to any relevant documentation improves the accessibility and visibility of the documentation. As a portal, ACCESS-Hive provides links to documentation hosted on other sites. It is not intended to host the documentation itself.


ACCESS-Hive is curated to ensure it is relevant and of reasonable quality, and all links have an annotated summary to help you find what you need. Annotations also makes the in-built live search function extremely effective.

## Support

There is a system of tags to identify who supports the linked documentation or software, and the level of support you can expect:

<div align="center"> {{supp}} Supported by ACCESS-NRI </div>

<div align="center"> {{recom}} Recommended by ACCESS-NRI </div>

<div align="center"> {{comm}} Community contributed </div>

See the [support page](about/support.md) for details about the support levels: what is supported, by who, and how to access help.
