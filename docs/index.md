ACCESS-Hive is a portal to all documentation relevant to the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator, ACCESS, and the wider ACCESS community. ACCESS-Hive is developed for and by the ACCESS community following an open-source development model.

ACCESS-Hive is part of an effort to design higher quality and more accessible documentation for ACCESS and its community. Providing a single access point to any relevant documentation improves the accessibility and visibility of the documentation. As a portal, ACCESS-Hive provides links to documentation hosted on other sites. It is not intended to host the documentation itself.


ACCESS-Hive is curated to ensure it is relevant and of reasonable quality, and all links have an annotated summary to help you find what you need. Annotations also makes the in-built live search function extremely effective.
