CICE is a software package developed by researchers at [Los Alamos National Laboratory team][lanl-web] with funding from the US Department of Energy. CICE models the dynamics and thermodynamics of ice. It calculates the complex physics of sea ice, such as how it freezes, melts, and moves across the ocean’s surface, and how it is influenced by external forces such as the ocean’s currents and winds.

The software program is managed by the [CICE Consortium][cice-web], an international group of institutions formed to maintain and develop CICE in the public domain.

CICE5 is the version currently used in ACCESS, but CICE6 is under development.
