[CASA (Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach)-CNP (Carbon-Nitrogen-Phosphorous)][casa-web] is the CABLE land surface model coupled with biogeochemistry (Terrestrial biogeochemistry).

CASA-CNP models the dynamics of carbon pools and nitrogen and phosphorous limitations. It is directly coupled with the CABLE land surface model.

CASA-CNP simulates the flow of carbon, and optionally, nitrogen and phosphorus between plant biomass pools, litter pools, organic soil pools, the inorganic soil mineral nitrogen pool and phosphorus soil pools. The flux of carbon from the land to the atmosphere has two components, net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and fluxes due to disturbance (e.g. fire) and land use change.

**How is CASA-CNP used?**

CASA-CNP is switched on for carbon-cycle to use in the Earth System Model 1.5 (ESM1.5) ACCESS configuration.
